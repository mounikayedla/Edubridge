Difference between CI and SI :1.Partial dependency can be injected using setter only but it is not possible by constructor.
Suppose there are 3 properties in a class having 3 arg constructor and setter methods. 
In such case, if you want to pass information for only 1property, it is possible by setter method only.
2.Setter injection overrides constructor injection.
 If we use both constructor and setter , IOC container will use setter injection.
3.we can easily change value by setter injection,
 it doesn't create new instance like constructor.
so setter injection is flexible than constructor injection.
