<p>Jesus (Greek: Ἰησοῦς, romanized: Iēsoûs, likely from Hebrew/Aramaic: יֵשׁוּעַ‎, romanized: Yēšûaʿ),
 c. 4 BC – AD 30 / 33, also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ,[e] was a first
-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.[11] He is the central figure of Christianity
, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the So
n and the awaited messiah (the Christ), prophesied in the Old Testament.[12][13]

Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically,[f] althou
gh the quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliab
ility of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the histo
rical Jesus, as the only records of Jesus's life are contained in the Gospels.[20][g][h] 
Jesus was a Galilean Jew,[11] who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own
 ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission[23] and he himself
 was often referred to as "rabbi".[24] Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow
 God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers.[25][26] Tradition
 holds that he was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities,[27] turned over to the 
Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.[25] 
After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they 
formed eventually became the early Church.[28]</p>

<p>History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation") is the scientific study of the past.
 Events occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
 "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, 
and interpretation of information about these events. Historians place the past in context
 using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, ecological markers, and material objects including art and artifacts.
 where to.History also includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze a sequence of past events,
 and investigate the patterns of cause and effect that are related to them.
 Historians seek to understand and represent the past through narratives. They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the
 significance of different causes and effects. Historians also
 debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective"
